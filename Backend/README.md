## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use
 üëÜ
A Backend application build on `FASTAPI` framework using:
  - FASTAPI
  - Python3
  - SQLALCHEMY
---

## ‚ú® Installation 
- Create a virtual environment
- Install the application dependencies
- Run locally using `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## ‚ú® Database connection

- Change your DATABASE_URL 
`DATABASE_URL = "mysql+mysqlconnector://root@localhost:3306/<nameof database table created>`
## üìù Notes

## ‚ú® How to collaborate
- Clone the dev branch with git clone <repo-link-here>
- checkout from dev branch to your new branch named this way `git checkout -b feat/BE-15-process-script`. In this example, BE-15 is the ticket number, process script is what it does.
- Add your changes to the new branch `git add .`
- Commit changes `git commit -m "feat(BE-15): added endpoints to process login scripts"` . If it is a bug fix, replace `feat` with `fix`. If  it is some basic chore like removing redundant code, replace with `chore`
- Now push your branch `git push origin feat/BE-15-process-script`
- Go to github and make a PR to the dev branch. Add description stating what the PR achieves. Add your linear link to the PR description also.
- Request for review from your team leads or mentors in the PR.
- Now wait for it to be merged by the team leads or mentors

- To learn about how to use FastAPI with most of its features, you can visit the [FastAPI Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/).
- FastAPI provides automatic documentation to call and test your API directly from the browser. You can access it at `/docs` with [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) or at `/redoc` with [Redoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc).
