					Effective use of and management of debt is a critical component of a

					the directors have a legal responsibility to make sure that the

						1. Reconsider your Company&apos;s Budget
					</h3>
					<p className="font-normal leading-[30px] text-lg text-[#667085] max-[675px]:text-base max-[675px]:leading-[25px]">
						Gather as much information as you can about your current financial
						status before attacking your company&quot;s debt. Business owners
						frequently take this action after falling behind on their monthly
						payments. To offer yourself extra room in your budget, take a look
						at your previous financial strategy. Your income streams, variable
						expenses, and fixed costs should all be listed in a business budget.
						A cash flow budget should also be included to account for
						anticipated transactions not covered by profit and loss, such as
						loan repayments, ATO responsibilities, and owner returns.

						2. Increase Cash Flow
					</h3>
					<p className="font-normal leading-[30px] text-lg text-[#667085] max-[675px]:text-base max-[675px]:leading-[25px]">
						Poorly managed cash flow can result in serious issues, such as
						difficulty fulfilling obligations on time, even in a thriving
						business.
						<br />
						<br />
						What methods can you employ to increase your cash flow?
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul className="font-normal leading-[30px] text-lg text-[#667085] max-[675px]:text-base max-[675px]:leading-[25px]">
							<li>
								&#x2022; Measurement and forecasting can help you stay on top of
								your company&apos;s cash flow and projected cash needs by
								comparing actual outcomes to your budget, comprehending and
								addressing any deviations, and regularly adjusting predictions.
							</li>
							<li>
								&#x2022; Improve the administration of payables and receivables
								by making sure that invoices for goods and services are sent out
								on time, and by reviewing the credit conditions that are offered
								to clients so that cash may be received for sales more quickly.
								To follow up on past-due monies, constantly review aged
								receivable records.

						3. Examine and Prioritise the Debts you Owe
					</h3>
					<p className="font-normal leading-[30px] text-lg text-[#667085] max-[675px]:text-base max-[675px]:leading-[25px]">
						Examine all of your existing debts, then begin to prioritize and
						make plans on how to reduce them.
						<br />
						<br />
						These could consist of, in no particular order:Suppliers; Revenue
						NSW (or other state OSR) liabilities, including payroll tax;
						Employer responsibilities, including Super Guarantee (SG); Bank
						loans, asset financing, or overdrafts;debts owed to the ATO, such as
						PAYGW, GST, and income tax.
						<br />
						<br />
						It&apos;s crucial to be aware that some obligations may have severe
						repercussions for late payment. For instance, employer Super
						Guarantee contributions are typically required to be made to each
						employee&apos;s chosen fund by 28 days following the end of each
						quarter, and there are heavy ATO penalties that apply for missing
						this deadline by even one day (via the Super Guarantee Charge).
