								Consumers can @mention a company on Twitter to ask questions.
								They can pick up the phone to voice complaints. They can even

								representative &#40;or in many cases, an AI-enabled
								chatbot&#41;. That means customer service teams need to have a
								way to manage requests across all communications channels and
								keep them organized. A help desk can provide multichannel
								support, so agents can work more efficiently, resolve issues
								faster, and offer amazing service. Manage cases quickly.

								Many people have had the frustrating experience of filling out a
								form on a company &#38;s website to ask a question only to have
								multiple customer support representatives follow up at different
								times. Sometimes, no one follows up at all. Regardless of the
								channel the request came thryough, a good customer service
								platform ensures that every inquiry routes to the right agent
								and gets organized &#40;or categorized&#41; accordingly. One
								person or team might handle Facebook and Twitter cases, for
								instance, while another team responds to phone calls. This
								enables every customer service team member to focus on priority
								cases, without leaving requests unanswered.{' '}

								Sometimes, people just want to solve their own issues, like

								To do this, companies need to have the right resources in place
								and make them easy to access. One way to make sure customers can
								help themselves is by creating an easy-to-nhavigate support
								portal. A support portal can house key information like FAQs.
								You could even create a public Q&A forum to help consumers
								connect with each other and share information. As customers
								continue to demand seamless experiences throughout their
